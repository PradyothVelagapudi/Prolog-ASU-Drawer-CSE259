Project Description: This PROLOG project prints out the letters "ASU" in various settings. It implements a predicate asu/4 that allows
the user to specify the left and right margins, top and bottom margins, space between characters, and the character size. 

		asu(LeftRightMargin, BottomTopMargin, SpaceBetweenCharacters, FontSize).

All of these input values must be nonnegative integers.

I was the sole member of this project team. Everything in this project is my original product.
